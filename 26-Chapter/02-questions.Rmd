# 1. Operating cycle

What are some of the characteristics of a firm with a long operating cycle?

A firm with a long operating cycle typically exhibits most or all of the
following characteristics:

1. __Sells goods that take a long time to manufacture or have slow inventory
   turnover__ Examples would be shipbuilding, aerospace, luxury yachts, heavy
   machinery, whiskey distillers, timber companies.

2. __Offers generaous or long credit terms to customers__ (long
   receivables/collection periods) Examples include exporters to developing
   countries, construction contractors, wholesalers in industries with 90--180
   day payment terms, manufacturers selling to large retailers or governments.

3. __Operates in a capital-intensive, project-based, or seasonal industry__
   Examples include defense contractors, commercial aircraft, large-scale
   construction, wineries, diamond wholesalers, art dealers.

4. __Has high levels of inventory and accounts receivable relative to sales__
   High inventory days (DSI > 100--200+ days) and high days sales outstanding
   (DSO > 60--90+ days). Operating cycle = DSI + DSO often exceeds 150--300+
   days (vs. 40--90 days for most retailers or consumer-goods firms).

5. __Requires significant working-capital financing__ Because cash is tied up
   for months or years there is a heavy reliance on bank lines, factoring,
   supply-chain finance, or long-term debt.

6. __Is more vulnerable to interest-rate risk and liquidity shocks__ A long
   operating cycle amplifies the impact of rising borrowing costs or credit
   tightening.

7. __Often has lower asset turnover and may show lower ROA__ (all else equal)
   because capital is locked up longer.

Firms with long operating cycles tend to be producers of expensive, complex,
customized, or age-dependent products and/or sell to customers who pay very
slowly. This structural feature forces them to finance a large, prolonged
investment in working capital.
