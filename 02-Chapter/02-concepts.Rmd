# 1. Liquidity

True or false: All assets are liquid at some price. Explain.

---

__False__. Some assets cannot be sold. For example, some intangible assets, such
as goodwill, are not liquid.

Liquidity (in finance) is how quickly and easily an asset can be converted into
cash at or near face value.

Goodwill is an accounting construct that arises when a company acquires another
and pays more than fair value of net assets.

Other intangible assets that are not liquid are brand recognition, patents, or
customer lists. These items may be valuable, but there isn't necessarily a
liquid market for them.

# 2. Accounting and cash flows

Why might the revenue and cost figures shown on a standard income statement not
represent the actual cash inflows and outflows that occurred during a period?

---

The revenue and cost figures shown on a standard income statement may not
represent the actual cash inflows and outflows that occurred during a period for
a company because the income statement is prepared using the accrual accounting
system. Accrual accounting records revenues when they are earned and expenses
when they are incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands.

# 3. Accounting statement of cash flows

Looking at the accounting statement of cash flows, what does the bottom line
number mean? How useful is this number for analyzing a company?

---

The bottom line number on the accounting statement of cash flows is the _Change
in cash_. This represents the net change, on the balance sheet, of accounting
cash from the previous period. This is a very useful number in understanding
financial cash flow because they show the differences between the three
components of the statement of cash flows:

* cash flow from operating activities
* cash flow from investing activities
* cash flow from financing activities

Pages 26 - 34

From ChatGPT

The _bottom line number_ on the accounting statement of cash flows represents
the _net change in cash_ during the reporting period. It is the difference
between the company's beginning and ending cash balances and is derived by
summing the cash flows from the three main activities:

1. __Operating Activities__: Cash generated or used in the company's core
   business operations.
2. __Investing Activities__: Cash spent on or received from the acquisition or
   disposal of long-term assets.
3. __Financing Activities__: Cash inflows and outflows from transactions with
   shareholders and creditors, such as issuing stock, borrowing, or repaying
   debt.

A positive net change in cash indicates that the company has increased its cash
reserves during the period, while a negative net change in cash shows that the
company has used more cash than it generated during the period.

The bottom line number has several advantages:

1. __Liquidity Insight__: It provides a snapshot of whether the company is
   generating or consuming cash, which is crucial for meeting short-term
   obligations.
2. __Cash Management__: Helps assess the company's ability to maintain
   sufficient cash reserves for operations, investments, and debt payments.
3. __Trend Analysis__: By comparing changes in cash over time, you can observe
   trends in cash generation and usage.

However, the bottom line number has some limitations:

1. __Not a measure of profitability__: The bottom line only shows cash movement,
   not profitability. A profitable company might have negative cash flows if
   it's investing heavily. On the opposite end, a low profitable company may
   have a high positive cash flow due to a one-time event, such as the sale of
   an asset.
2. __Lacks Detailed Insight__: A positive or negative number doesn't explain the
   cause. To understand it fully, you must analyze the cash flow from
   _operating_, _investing_, and _financing activities_ individually.
3. __Doesn't Address Sustainability__: A company could increase cash through
   unsustainable methods (e.g, excessive borrowing or asset sales).

## Summary

The bottom line number on the statement of cash flows is a valuable indicator
of a company's liquidity and financial flexibility, but it must be analyzed
alongside other financial metrics and details from the cash flow statement to
provide meaningful insights into the company's financial health and
sustainability.

# 4. Cash flows

How do financial cash flows and the accounting statement of cash flows differ?
Which is more useful for analyzing a company?

---

## Financial cash flows

Focus on the cash available to investors (shareholders and creditors).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Financial\ cash\ flow} &= \text{cash flow from assets} \\
  &= \text{operating cash flow} - \text{net capital spending}
  - \text{change in net working capital}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Cash generated from the company's operations (OCF).
- Reinvestment in long-term assets (capital spending).
- Changes in working capital requirements.
- Net cash flows available to distribute to creditors and shareholders.

The purpose of financial cash flows is to help assess the company's ability to
generate cash to meet obligations and provide returns to investors.

Financial cash flows strip out non-cash items and accounting adjustments and
provides a clear view of how much cash is available for debt service and
shareholder returns.

## Account statement of cash flows

Summarizing actual cash inflows and outflows from three activities:
_operating_, _investing_, and _financing_.

1. __Operating Activities__: Cash from day-to-day business operations.
2. __Investing Activities__: Cash from buying/selling assets.
3. __Financing Activities__: Cash from debt and equity transactions.

- Tracks the company's cash position and liquidity.
- Matches the accounting framework (GAAP or IFRS).

The purpose of the accounting statement of cash flows is to ensure transparency
in financial reporting and provides detailed insights into where cash is coming
from and going to.

Accounting statement of cash flows offer a comprehensive and detailed breakdown
of cash movements and useful for identifying specific sources of cash flow
issues (e.g., excessive capital spending, operational inefficiencies).

## Which is more useful for analyzing a company?

Financial cash flows are more useful for investors assessing the company's
capacity to return cash and determining the sustainability of growth and
profitability. The account statement of cash flows is more useful for assessing
liquidity and operational health, and for understanding cash management
practices of the firm.

## Summary

The accounting statement of cash flows is more comprehensive for understanding
short-term liquidity and detailed cash movements. However, financial cash flows
provide a clearer picture of the company's ability to generate value for
investors. Both are valuable tools, and their usefulness depends on the
specific analysis being performed. Ideally, they should be used together for a
well-rounded assessment.

# 5. Book values versus market values

Under standard accounting rules, it is possible for a company's liabilities to
exceed its assets. When this occurs, the owners' equity is negative. Can this
happen with market values? Why or why not?

---

Standard accounting rules do allow for a company's liabilities to exceed its
assets, resulting in negative shareholders' equity. However, this is not the
case with market values because shareholders have limited liability and are not
responsible for debt beyond their initial investment.

---

Answer from chatGPT:

Under standard accounting rules, liabilities can exceed assets, leading to
negative owners' equity. However, this is unlikely to occur with market values.

## Accounting perspective

Accounting values for assets are recorded at historical cost minus deprecation,
which may not reflect their current market value. If liabilities exceed the
book value of assets, equity becomes negative.

## Market value perspective

Market value reflects investors' perception of the company's value based on
future earnings potential, assets' current market value, and overall market
sentiment.

The market value of equity is derived as:

$$
\mathbf{Market\ Value\ of\ Equity} = \text{Market Value of Assets}
  - \text{Market Value of Liabilities}
$$

Investors rarely assign a negative market value to equity because shareholders
have limited liability; they are not personally responsible for debt beyond
their initial investment. If liabilities exceed assets, the market value of
equity may approach zero, but not go negative.

Therefore, there are three reasons why market values of firms do not go
negative:

1. __Limited Liability:__ Shareholders cannot owe more than the value of their
   equity investment. The worst-case scenario is that equity becomes worthless.
2. __Future Expectations:__ The market often values a company based on its
   potential future cash flows, even if it is currently in financial distress.
   This "hope value" can keep the equity market value above zero.
3. __Liquidation Value of Assets:__ Even in bankruptcy, the company's assets
   may retain some liquidation value, reducing the gap between liabilities and
   assets.

# 6. Cash flow from assets

Why is it not necessarily bad for the cash flow from assets to be negative for
a particular period?

---

Cash flow from assets is defined:

$$
\text{CF}(A) = \text{Operating cash flow} + \text{Depreciation} - \text{Taxes}
$$

Here

Page 29

---

From ChatGPT

There are several reasons why cash flows from assets may be negative for a
particular period and they do not indicate any real cause for concern:

1. A company may be heavily investing in capital expenditures (e.g., purchasing
   new equipment, expanding facilities, or acquiring assets) to support future
   growth.
2. Increasing net working capital can cause negative CFFA, such as when a
   retailer builds up inventory ahead of a major sale season.
3. One time costs can cause negative CFFA. These could be restructuring costs
   or costs of acquisitions.

Negative CFFA can be a problem:

1. If negative CFFA occurs consistently without accompanying growth in revenue
   or profitability could indicate operational inefficiencies or excessive
   spending.
2. If the firm has weak cash reserves, leading to liquidity issues and
   distress.
3. If the firm made poor investment decisions that did not generate sufficient
   returns.

When assessing the implication of negative CFFA, consider:

1. The stage of the company. Is it a startup in a high growth environment. Then
   the negative CFFA could be because it is heavily reinvesting. Just make sure
   there are no liquidity issues.
2. A company may finance negative CFFA through equity or debt issuance is
   leveraging future cash flows. This can be sustainable if the returns on
   investment exceed the cost of capital.
3. Negative CFFA is acceptable if it leads to future cash flows.

---

# 7. Operating cash flow

Why is it not necessarily bad for the operating cash flow to be negative for a
particular period?

---

There are several reasons why negative operating cash flow (OCF) may not be
concerning:

1. Investment for growth
2. Seasonal fluctuations of the business cycles may produce expected negative
   operating cash flows.
3. Strategic investments, such as in inventory or prepaying expenses may lead
   to temporary negative operating cash flow.
4. Broader economic or industry specific events, such as a recession, can lead
   to short-term negative operating cash flow.

If negative cash flows are consistent or if the company is in financial
distress then there is a reason to be concerned.

---

# 8. Net working capital and capital spending

Could a company's change in net working capital be negative in a given year?
(_Hint:_ Yes.) Explain how this might come about. What about net capital
spending?

---

From chatGPT

## Net working capital

Net working capital is calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{Net\ Working\ Capital} = \text{Current Assets}
  - \text{Current Liabilities}
$$

A negative change in net working capital means that the current liabilities have
increased more than the current assets (or its current assets decreased more
than its current liabilities). This can occur because:

#### Decreasing current assets

- The company is collecting accounts receivable faster, reducing outstanding
  balances.
- Inventory levels are reduced, due to efficient inventory management or lower
  production.  The company uses cash reserves to pay off liabilities or fund
  operations.

#### Increasing current liabilities

- The company delays paying accounts payable to suppliers, increasing its
  short-term obligations.
- The company takes on more short-term debt, such as notes payable or credit
  line, to finance operations or growth.

#### Operations strategy

- A company might deliberately reduce NWC to free up cash for investments or
  other uses. For example, by managing receivables or extending payables, the
  company improves cash flow.

## Net capital spending

Net capital spending can be calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{Net\ Capital\ Spending} = \text{Ending Net Fixed Assets}
  - \text{Beginning Net Fixed Assets} + \text{Deprecation}
$$

Negative net capital spending might occur when:

1. The company sells fixed assets (e.g., property, equipment) to generate cash,
   often during restructuring or downsizing.
2. The company chooses not to purchase significant new fixed assets, possibly
   due to a focus on efficiency, reduced growth plans, or financial
   constraints.
3. Fixed asset purchases are smaller than the deprecation expense for the
   period, resulting in a net reduction in the value of fixed assets.

## Summary

Negative NWC change is often due to increased liabilities or decreased current
assets, which can be strategic to improve cash flow. Negative net capital
spending is often selling off more fixed assets than it is investing in, which
may be part of a restructuring or a cash-raising efforts.

# 9. Cash flow to stockholders and creditors

Could a company's cash flow to stockholders be negative in a given year?
(_Hint:_ Yes.) Explain how this might come about. What about cash flow to
creditors?

---

## Cash flow to stockholders (CFS)

Cash flow to stockholders is calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{Cash\ flow\ to\ stockholders} = \text{dividends paid}
  - \text{net new equity raised}
$$

Negative cash flow to stockholders can occur because:

1. Issuance of new equity for growth
2. Reduction in dividends

## Cash flow to creditors (CFC)

Cash flow to creditors is calculated as:

$$
\mathbf{Cash\ flow\ to\ creditors} = \text{interest paid}
  - \text{net new borrowing}
$$

Negative cash flow to creditors could occur because:

1. Issuance of new debt to finance growth
2. refinancing or restructuring debt with new terms resulting in net borrowing
   that exceeds interest payments (replacing short-term debt with long-term
   bonds to reduce interest costs over time).
3. The firm has a low interest burden relative to the new debt that it takes
   on, especially during periods of low-interest rates.

## Key considerations

Negative cash flow to stockholders:

- May signal growth or strategic equity financing.
- Can also indicate reduced shareholder returns in the short term.

Negative cash flow to creditors:

- often reflects the company leveraging debt for investment or expansion.
- However, excessive borrowing migh indicate rising financial risk.

# 10. Firm values

Referring back to the Bank of America example at the beginning of the chapter,
note that we suggested that Bank of America's stockholders probably didn't
suffer as a result of the reported loss. What do you think was the basis for
our conclusion?

---

The basis for the conclusion that _Bank of America's stockholders probably
didn't suffer as a result of the reported write-offs_ is rooted in the
distinction between _accounting losses_ (such as write-offs) and _actual cash
loses_. Here are the key points that explain why stockholders likely didn't
experience significant losses:

## Write-offs are non-cash expenses

A _write-off_ is essentially an accounting adjustment that reduces the book
value of an asset, typically when it is deemed uncollectible or impaired (e.g.,
bad loans or the declining value of assets). However, _write-offs_ are
_non-cash_ transactions. They don't represent an actual outflow of cash. In the
case of Bank of America's \$34 billion write-off for bad loans, the company
wasn't actually paying out that \$34 billion in cash. Instead, they were
acknowledging that the value of certain assets (loans) had declined.

## Write-offs clean up the balance sheet

While write-offs reduce the company's reported _net income_ and asset values,
they also _clean up the balance sheet_ by removing impaired assets. This allows
the company to more accurately reflect its true financial position going
forward. As a result, these write-offs can make the company's financial
statements more transparent, which could actually increase investor confidence.

## Write-offs can reflect conservative financial management

Large write-offs, especially during economic downturns, can be viewed as a
_prudent_ measure by management to prepare for future losses. This reflects
that the company is taking action to acknowledge and deal with problems early.
Investors might view this as _responsible management_ rather than something to
fear.

## Future earnings and cash flow are unaffected

__Cash flow__---which is the actual movement of money in and out of the
company---is unaffected by write-offs. Even though write-offs might lead to
reported losses, they do not impact the company's ability to generate cash in
the future. If the bank continues to make loans and earn interest income, or if
it finds new profitable opportunities, stockholders could still benefit in the
long term.

## Market reaction may be more about the future

Investors typically care more about _future earnings potential_ than about past
write-offs. The stock price of a company like Bank of America would likely
reflect investors' expectations for future performance, rather than simply
reacting to the past losses reported in the income statement.

## Broader economic and regulatory context

During period of economic stress, like the 2008--2009 financial crisis, large
financial institutions often face widespread asset impairments. These
write-offs, while large in nominal terms, are somewhat expected by investors
who understand the risks in the banking industry. Additionally, government
interventions (such as bailouts or stimulus packages) often provide a safety
net, further cushioning stockholder losses.
