# 1. Employee Stock Options

Why do companies issue options to executives if they cost the company more than
they are worth to the executive? Why not just give cash and split the
difference? Wouldn't that make both the company and the executive better off?

From pages __726 and 727__ The main reasons why companies use options as a
compensation for executives is because it helps to align the interests of the
executive with the company. By issuing options to buy the company stock, the
executive has an incentive to increase the value of the company. Other reasons
are to take away the pay disparity between executives and employees as an issue
of contention, and options are also a more tax-efficient way to pay employees.

# 2. Real Options

What are the two options that many businesses have?

From the last paragraph of __page 732__. The notion of embedded options is at
the heart of business. There are two possible outcomes for virtually every
business idea. On the one hand, the business may fail, in which case the
managers will probably try to shut it down in the most cost-efficient way. On
the other hand, the business may prosper, in which case the managers will try to
expand. All businesses have the option to abondon and the option to expand.

# 3. Project Analysis

Why does a strict NPV calculation typically understate the value of a company or
project?

A strict NPV (Net Present Value) calculation understates the true value of a
company or project because it assumes no managerial flexibility---that is, it
treats future decisions as fixed and ignores the value of being able to adapt
when uncertainty is resolved.

## Traditional NPV assumes passive management

The NPV rule values a project as:

\[
\text{NPV} = \sum^T_{t=1}{\frac{E[\text{Cash Flow}_t]}{(1 + r)^t}}
    - \text{Initial Investment}
\]

This formula assumes:

* The investment is made once, now.
* The firm cannot alter or abandon the project later.
* Cash flows are fixed and known (or expected) values.

In reality, managers can---and do---respond to changes in circumstances.

## In reality, management has flexibility

Managers can:

* __Delay__ invsting until more information arrives (option to wait),
* __Expand__ if the project goes well (option to expand),
* __Abandon__ if it performs poorly (option to abandon),
* __Switch__ inputs, outputs, or production methods (option to switch).

Each of these is a real option that has value, especially under uncertainty.

## Ignoring flexibility undervalues projects

A strict NPV treats a project like a _commitment_, not an _opportunity_.

* The downside can be limited (you can walk away or scale down).
* The upside can be large (you can expand or invest more).

Thus, the true value is:

\[
\text{True value} = \text{NPV}_{\text{static}} + \text{Value of Real Options}
\]

Because $\text{Value of Real Options} \ge 0$, a simple NPV analysis will
understate the project's worth.

## Analogy to financial options

Just as owning a call option on a stock gives you the right but not the
obligation to buy, having a project opportunity gives management the right but
not the obligation to proceed, expand, or stop. Ignoring that "optionality" is
like valuing an option at zero---clearly an underestimate.

# 4. Real Options

Utility companies often face a decision to build new plants that burn coal, oil,
or both. If the prices of both coal and gas are highly volatile, how valuable is
the decision to build a plant that can burn either coal or oil? What happens to
the value of this option as the correlation between coal and oil prices
increases?

The ability to choose which fuel to burn is a real option---an option to switch.

* If coal prices rise but oil prices fall $\rightarrow$ you burn oil.
* If oil rises but coal falls $\rightarrow$ you burn coal.
* You always choose the lower-cost fuel.

This flexibility reduces your exposure to fuel price uncertainty---it's
economically valuable, just like owning a portfolio that lets you switch between
assets.

## The value of the option depends on uncertainty

The value of the option to switch (i.e., to choose between fuels) increases
when:

* The volatility (uncertainty) of fuel prices increases, and
* The prices are not perfectly correlated.

This is because:

* More volatility $\rightarrow$ greater potential for one fuel to become much
  cheaper than the other.

* Lower correlation $\rightarrow$ prices move more independently, creating more
  opportunities to switch profitably.

## As correlation increases...

If the correlation between coal and oil prices increases, then:

* The two fuel prices move more closely together.

* When coal becomes expensive, oil likely becomes expensive too---and vice
  versa.

* The advantage of having a choice diminishes, because there are fewer
  situations where one fuel is much cheaper than the other.

Hence

\[
\text{Value of the switching option} \downarrow\ \text{as correlation}\ \uparrow
\]

At the extreme:

* If the correlation = 1 (perfectly correlated), the two prices always move
  together.

* Then switching has no value, because whichever fuel you use costs the same
  relative to the other.
