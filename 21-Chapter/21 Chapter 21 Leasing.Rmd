# Summary and Conclusions
A large fraction of America's equipment is leased rather than purchased. This
chapter both described the institutional arrangements surrounding leases and
showed how to evaluate leases financially.

1. Leases can be separated into two polar types. Though operating leases allow
   the lessee to use the euipment, ownership remains with the lessor. Although
   the lessor in a financial lease legally owns the equipment, the lessee
   maintains effective ownership because financial leases are fully amortized.

2. When a firm purchases an asset with debt, both the asset and the liability
   appear on the firm's balance sheet. If a lease meets at least one of a number
   of criteria, it must be capitalized. This means that the present value of the
   lease appears as both an asset and a liability. A lease escapes
   capitalization if it does not meet any of these criteria. Leases not meeting
   the criteria are called _operating leases_, though the accountant's
   definition differs somewhat from the practitioner's definition. Operating
   leases do not appear on the balance sheet. For cosmetic reasons, many firms
   prefer that a lease be called _operating_.

3. Firms generally lease for tax purposes. To protect its interest, the IRS
   allows financial arrangements to be classified as leases only if a number of
   criteria are met.

4. We showed that risk-free cash flows should be discounted at the aftertax
   risk-free rate. Because both lease payments and depreciation tax shields are
   nearly riskless.

5. Though this method is simple, it lacks certain intuitive appeal. We presented
   an alternative method in the hopes of increasing the reader's intuition.
   Relative to a lease, a purchase generates debt capacity. This increase in
   debt capacity can be calculated by discounting the difference between the
   cash flows of the purchase and the cash flows of the lease by the aftertax
   interest rate. The increase in debt capacity from a purchase is compared to
   the extra outflow at Year 0 from a purchase.

6. If the lessor is in the same tax bracket as the lessee, the cash flows to the
   lessor are exactly the opposite of the cash flows to the lessee. Thus, the
   sum of the value of the lease to the lessee plus the value of the lease to
   the lessor must be zero. Although this suggests that leases can never fly,
   there are actually at least three good reasons for leasing:

   a. Differences in tax brackets betweent he lessor and lessee.
   b. Shift of risk bearing to the lessor.
   c. Minimization of transaction costs.

   We also document a number of bad reasons for leasing.

# Concept Questions

## Leasing vs. borrowing

What are the key differences between leasing and borrowing? Are they perfect
substitutes?

---

### Key differences between leasing and borrowing:

* __Ownership:__ Lessee does not own the equipment. The borrower owns the asset.
* __Balance Sheet:__ Leasing equipment may be off-balance sheet (operating
  lease) or on it (finance lease). The borrower has both the asset and the loan
  on the balance sheet.
* __Upfront Cost:__ Leasing usually has a lower upfront cost (no down payment).
  Borrowing may require a down payment.
* __Maintenance:__ Usually handled by the lessor, but the responsiblity for
  maintenance falls on the borrower/owner.
* __Duration:__ Leasing is often short term. Borrowing is usually longer-term
  financing.
* __Tax treatment:__ Lease payments may be fully deductible as operating
  expenses. For borrowing, deprecation and interest are separately deductible.
* __Flexibility:__ More flexible---you can walk away at the end of a lease.
  Borrowing is less flexible---you own the asset and must sell/dispose.
* __Risk of obsolescence:__ Lessor bears more risk of obsolescence. Borrower
  bears the risk of declining asset value.

No, leasing and borrowing are not perfect substitutes. They differ in several
areas.

---

## Leasing and taxes

Taxes are an important consideration in the leasing decision. Which is more
likely to lease: A profitable corporation in a high tax bracket or a less
profitable one in a low tax bracket? Why?

---

A less profitable corporation in a low tax bracket is more likely to lease. Tax
benefits from ownership---like deprecation deductions and interest expense
deductions---are only valuable if the company is actually paying significant
taxes.

---

## Leasing and IRR

What are some of the potential problems with looking at IRRs when evaluating a
leasing decision?

---

1. __IRR ignores the cost of capital:__ IRR tells you the return in isolation.
   But in leasing, you're comparing cash flows to an alternative (like borrowing
   and buying). What really matters is how the lease compars to your cost of
   capital, not the absolute IRR of the lease.

2. __Multiple IRRs:__ A leasing cash flow stream might have alternating signs
   (e.g., upfront costs, residual value at the end). This can lead to multiple
   IRRs, making interpretation confusing or meaningless.

3. __Reinvestment rate assumption:__ IRR assumes that intermediate cash flows
   are reinvested at the IRR itself, which may be unrealistic---especially for
   leasing cash flows that may not be reinvested at the same rate.

4. __Doesn't account for taxes clearly:__ Leasing decisions are very
   tax-sensitive. IRR doesn't easily separate pre-tax vs. after-tax cash flows,
   which can distort comparisons if taxes aren't modeled correctly.

5. __IRR doesn't reflect scale:__ A high IRR on a small lease deal might look
   attractive but deliver much less value than a lower IRR on a larger
   transaction. Leasing is often a strategic financing choice, not just an
   investment.

IRR can mislead in leasing decisions due to multiple rates, tax complexity, and
poor comparison to financing alternatives.

### Alternatives:

1. __NPV (Net present value):__ with after-tax cash flows and appropriate
   discount rates.
2. __Equivalent loan analysis:__ Comparing lease payments to debt financing
3. __Lease-vs-buy analysis:__ side-by-side cash flow modeling

## Leasing

Comment on the following remarks:

a. Leasing reduces risk and can reduce a firm's cost of capital.
b. Leasing provides 100 percent financing.
c. If the tax advantages of leasing were eliminated, leasing would disappear.

---

### Leasing reduces risk and can reduce a firm's cost of capital

This is partially true, but not always.

Leasing can reduce risk. It provides flexibilty---especially with shorter-term
or cancelable leases. It may shift obsolescence risk (e.g., with technology or
equipment) to the lessor. It can also avoid large upfron costs and preserve cash
for operations.

However, it doesn't automatically lower cost of capital. Leasing is still a form
of financing---and the lessor prices in their own required return. If the firm
could borrow at a cheaper rate than the implied lease rate, leasing could be
more expensive. Rating agencies and investors often treat leases as debt-like,
especially capital/finance leases.

### Leasing provides 100 percent financing

This is mostly true.

In many leases, especially operating leases, the lessee gets use of the asset
without a down payment---effectively 100\% financing. It allows firms to avoid
upfront cash outflows and preserve working capital.

However, there might be initial fees, security deposits, or advance payments.
For long-term leases, the present value of lease obligations is economically
similar to taking on debt---so it's financing, just in a different wrapper.

### If the tax advantages of leasing were eliminated, leasing would disappear

Probably true.

Tax benefits are a big driver (like depreciaction being used by the lessor and
shared via lower payments), leasing also offers:

* Flexibility---easier to return/upgrade assets
* Convenience---simple than securing a loan
* Risk transfer---obsolescence, maintenance
* Off-balance-sheet financing---less so now, but strategically useful

---

## Accounting for leases

Discuss the accounting criteria for determining whether a lease must be reported
on the balance sheet. In each case give a rationale for the criterion.

---

Accounting treatment of leases has evolved significantly, especially with the
adoption of ASC 842 (U.S. GAAP) and IFRS 16 internationally. These standards
were created to increase transparency, since leases often represent significant
liabilities.

Under current U.S. GAAP (ASC 842), all leases longer than 12 months must be
reported on the balance sheet. They're classified as either: (1) Operating
lease, or (2) finance lease (formerly "capital lease"). For both, companies must
recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability.

A lease is classified as a finance lease (similar to a purchase) if any one of
these 5 criteria is met:

1. __Transfer of ownership:__ The lease transfers ownership of the asset to the
   lessee by the end of the lease term. The lessee essentially buys the asset,
   so it should be treated as an acquisition.
2. __Bargain purchase option:__ The lease contains a bargain purchase option---a
   right to buy the asset at a price well below fair value. The lessee is very
   likely to exercise the option, making it economically equivalent to a
   purchase.
3. __Lease term is a major part of economic life:__ The lease term covers a
   major part (generally 75% or more) of the asset's useful life. The lessee
   essentially uses up the asset, implying control over its economic value.
4. __Present value of lease payments $\approx$ fair value:__ The present value
   of lease payments amounts to substantially all (typically ~90\%) of the
   asset's fair value. If you're paying nearly the full value of the asset, it's
   like a financed purchase.
5. __Specialized asset:__ The asset is so specialized that it has no alternative
   use to the lessor at lease-end. Only the lessee can use it, implying they
   have economic control.
6. __Operating lease (also on balance sheet):__ Doesn't meet any of the 5
   finance lease criteria. Still recognized as a right-of-use asset and lease
   liability, but expense is recorded straight-line over the lease term (rather
   than as amortization + interest).
7. __Rationale for on-balance-sheet recognition (ASC 842 & IFRS 16):__ Old rules
   let many leases by off-balance sheet, which masked financial obligations. New
   standards require lessees to show all significant leases to improve
   transparency for investors and creditors.

---

## IRS criteria

Discuss the IRS criteria for determining whether a lease is tax deductible. In
each case give a rationale for the criterion.

---

The IRS criteria for determining whether a lease is tax-deductible focus on
ensuring that the lease is a true rental arrangement, rather than a disguised
purchase of financing deal. These guidelines help determine whether lease
payments can be fully deducted as an operating expense or if the transaction
must be treated as a capital lease for tax purposes.

### No transfer of ownership

The lease must not automatically transfer ownership of the asset to the lessee
at the end of the lease term.

If ownership transfers, it's essentially a sale, and the asset must be
capitalized and depreciated. In a true lease, the lessee only pays for the right
to use the asset, not to own it.

### No bargain purchase option

The lease should not offer a bargain purchase option, meaning the lessee
shouldn't be able to buy the asset at the end for significantly less than fair
market value.

A bargain option signals that the lessee is effectively buying the asset, with
lease payments acting like installment payments toward ownership.

### Lease term must not be too long

The lease term should not cover the majority of the asset's useful life (often
interpreted as less than 75\%).

If the lessee uses the asset for nearly all its useful life, they've gained the
primary economic value, just like an owner would.

### Present value of lease payments must not approximate asset's value

The present value of lease payments should not be substantially equal to the
asset's fair market value (often interpreted as less than 90%).

If the lessee is paying almost the entire value of the asset over time, it's
financially equivalent to buying the asset.

### No creation of equity or ownership benefits

The lease must not give the lessee any ownership-like benefits, such as profits
from resale or value appreciation.

Leasing is about using the asset, not profiting from ownership. Ownershiplike
benefits blur the line between lease and purchase.

### Lessor must bear meaningful ownership risk

The lessor must retain significant risk of ownership (e.g., risk of
obsolescence, residual value changes, or major repairs).

If the lessee assumes all the risks, they're acting as an owner, and the IRS may
treat the arrangement as a financing agreement rather than a true lease.

### Fair market value for renewals or extensions

Any renewal or extension option must be at fair market rent, not a discoutned or
"bargain" rate.

Bargain renewal  terms give the lessee continued control at reduced cost,
implying ownership-like control.

---

## Off-balance sheet financing

What is meant by the term _off-balance sheet financing_? When do leases provide
such financing, and what are the accounting and economic consequences of such
activity?

---

Off-balance sheet financing refers to any method a company uses to acquire
assets or fund operations without reporting the associated liabilities or assets
directly on its balance sheet. The goal is often to make the company appear less
leveraged (i.e., less in debt) and financially healthier than it actually
is---at least from a superficial view.

Off-balance sheet financing examples are: operating leases (under old accounting
rules), joint ventures, partnerships, and special purpose entities (SPEs). The
costs and risks are real, but don't show up in the traditional balance sheet
presentation.

Historically, operating leases (under older accounting standards like ASC 840 in
the U.S.) allowed companies to: use an asset (like a building or equipment), pay
periodic lease payments, and avoid recording the asset and corresponding
liability on the balance sheet.

From an economic standpoint, whether a company buys or leases an asset
long-term, it still controls the asset, bears most of the economic benefits and
risks, and has an obligation to make payments.

To increase transparency, accounting standards like ASC 842 (U.S. GAAP) and IFRS
16 (international) now require most leases (including operating leases longer
than 12 months) to be recorded on the balance sheet, with a right-of-use asset,
and a lease liability.

---

## Sale and leaseback

Why might a firm choose to engage in a sale and leaseback transaction? Give two
reasons.

---

A firm might choose to engage in a sale and lease back transaction for a couple
of strategic and financial reasons.

### To free up cash and improve liquidity

In a sale and leaseback, the company sells an owned asset (like real estate,
equipment, etc...) to another party and immediately leases it back to continue
using it.

The sale generates an immediate cash inflow, which the firm can use to: pay down
debt, invest in new projects, and fund working capital. This can improve the
company's liquidity and flexibility without disrupting operations.

### To improve financial ratios and offload ownership risks

Even though modern accounting standards now put most leases on the balance
sheet, sale and leaseback can still: reduce asset intensity (by removing the
asset from the books), potentially improve return on assets (ROA) and asset
turnover, and shift the risks of ownership (like maintenance, obsolescence, or
value decline) to the new owner/lessor.

---

## Leasing cost

Explain why the after tax borrowing rate is the appropriate discount rate to use
in lease evaluation.

---

The after-tax borrowing rate is the appropriate discount rate to use in lease
evaluation because it accurately reflects the true cost of financing for the
firm after considering the tax implications.

### Leasing and borrowing are financing alternatives

When a firm leases an asset, it's essentially choosing not to borrow money to
buy the asset. So, the lease must be compared to the cost of using debt
financing, which is the firm's borrowing rate.

### Interest on debt is tax-deductible

Jus like lease payments may be partially or fully tax-deductible, interest on
debt is typically tax-deductible. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we
must adjust the borrowing rate for taxes:

$$
\text{After-tax borrowing rate} = \text{Pre-tax rate}
  \times (1 - \text{Tax rate})
$$

This reflects the true economic cost of borrowing funds when taxes are
considered.

### Lease cash flows are evaluated after taxes

When evaluating a lease, the cash flows (like lease payments and tax shields)
are considered on an after-tax basis. Therefore, to discount these after-tax
cash flows appropriately, we need to use an after-tax discount rate---i.e., the
after-tax borrowing rate.

---

Refer to the following example for the next three questions. In May 2011, Air
Lease COrporation (ALC) announced that it had signed lease agreements for 29
aircraft with Asia-region airlines. The customers included China Eastern, China
Southern, Air China, Asiana, Garuda, MIAT Mongolian, and Orient Thai Airlines.
In the largest lease agreement, China Eastern Airlines and ALC entered into
long-term lease agreements for 10 new Airbus A320-200s and five new Boeing
B737-800s, with delivery scheduled in 2012 and 2013.

## Leasing vs. purchase

Why wouldn't China Eastern Airlines purchase the planes if they were obviously
needed for the company's operations?

---

### Preserve capital / liquidity

Aircraft are expensive---each one can cost tens of millions of dollars. By
leasing, China Eastern avoids large upfront capital outlays, freeing cash for
other investments or working capital needs.

### Fleet flexibility

Leasing offers flexibility to return, upgrade, or change aircraft as market
demands shift. This is especially important in an industry affected by fuel
prices, regulation, and shifting demand.

### Reduce balance sheet debt

Buying planes would increase debt and leverage ratios, possibly hurting credit
ratings. Leasing can improve financial ratios and keep liabilities lower,
depending on accounting treatment.

### Tax or regulatory considerations

Some leases offer tax benefits or avoid regulatory complexities tied to
international aircraft ownership.

---

## Reasons to lease

Why would ALC be willing to buy planes from Boeing and Airbus and then lease the
planes to China Eastern Airlines? How is this different from just lending money
to China Eastern Airlines to buy the planes?

---

ALC acts as a specialized financial intermediary---think of it as the real
estate landlord of aviation.

### Earn steady cash flow

ALC receives long-term, predictable lease payments from airlines---a stable
income stream.

### Specialized asset management

ALC has deep expertise in aircraft valuation, maintenance, and resale. It can
re-market planes across different regions and carriers, reducing downtime and
risk.

### Control the asset

Unlike a simple loan, ALC owns the aircraft. This gives ALC security---if China
Eastern defaults, ALC can reclaim and re-lease or sell the plane.

---

## Leasing

What do you suppose happens to the plane at the end of the lease period?

---

### Return the aircraft

The plane goes back to ALC, who may re-lease it to another airline or sell it on
the secondary market.

### Lease renewal / extension

China Eastern might extend the lease if the plane still fits their needs.

### Purchase option

Some leases offer a purchase option at the end for fair market value or a
preagreed price.

---

# Questions and problems

Use the following information to work the following 6 problems. You work for a
nuclear research laboratory that is contemplating leasing a diagnostic scanner
(leasing is a common practice with expensive, high-tech equipment). The scanner
costs \$5,200,000, and it would be depreciated straight-line to zero over four
years. Because of radiation contamination, it will actually be completely
valueless in four years. You can lease it for \$1,525,000 per year for four
years.

## Lease or buy

Assume that the tax rate is 35 percent. You can borrow at 8 percent before
taxes. Should you lease or buy?

---

* Cost of scnner: \$5,200,000
* Lease payment: \$1,525,000 per year for 4 years
* Depreciation: straight-line to 0 over 4  years \$1,300,000 per year
* Tax rate: .35
* Pre-tax borrowing rate: .08
* After-tax borrowing rate: $.08 \times (1 - .35) = .052$

### Calculate the net cost of leasing

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{After-tax lease payment} &= 1,525,000 \times (1 - .35) = 991,250
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PV of lease} &= 991,250
  \times \left(\frac{1 - (1 + 0.052)^{-4}}{0.052}\right)\\
  \approx 991,250 \times 3.54595\\
  \approx 3,516,253
\end{aligned}
$$

### Calculate the net cost of buying

We assume the scanner is bought outright, financed at 8\%, and the value
depreciates to zero in 4 years.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Annual depreciation} &= \frac{5,200,000}{4}\\
  &= 1,300,000\\\\
\text{Annual tax shield} &= 1,300,000 \times 0.35\\
  &= 455,000
\end{aligned}
$$

Discount the tax shields at the after-tax borrowing rate (5.2\%):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PV of tax shields} &= 455,000 \times 3.54595\\
  &\approx 1,614,110
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the full \$5.2 million is paid upfront (or equivalently borrowed), the PV
of outflow = \$5,200,000. Subtract the PV of the tax shield.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Net cost of buying} &= 5,200,000 - 1,614,110\\
  &= 3,585,890
\end{aligned}
$$

* Lease: \$3,516,253
* Buy: \$3,585,890

Conclusion: Leasing is slightly cheaper by \$69,637 in present value terms. So,
you should lease the diagnostic scanner.

---

## Leasing cash flows

What are the cash flows from the lease from the lessor's viewpoint? Assume a 35
percent tax bracket.

---

* Lease payment: \$1,525,000 per year for 4 years
* Cost of scanner: \$5,200,000 lessor buys it
* Depreciation method: Straight-line to zero over 4 years
* Depreciation per year: \$1,300,000
* Tax rate: .35
* After tax borrow rate: 0.05

### Calculate annual taxable income for the lessor

Each year, the lessor recieves lease income of \$1,525,000 but also gets a tax
deduction for depreciation of \$1,300,000.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Taxable income} &= \text{Lease payment} - \text{Depreciation}\\
  &= 1,525,000 - 1,300,000\\
  &= 225,000\\\\
\text{taxes paid} &= 225,000 \times 0.35\\
  &= 78,750
\end{aligned}
$$

### Calculate after-tax cash flow per year

The cash inflow is the full lease payment. The tax outflow is based on taxable
income:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{After-tax lease cash flow} &= \text{Lease payment} - \text{Taxes}\\
  &= 1,525,000 - 78,750\\
  &= 1,446,250
\end{aligned}
$$

### NPV of cash flow stream

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Cash flow stream} &= (-5,200,000 + 1,446,250 + 1,446,250 + 1,446,250 + 1,446,250)\\
\text{NPV} &= -5,200,000 + 1,446,250 \times \frac{1 - (1 + .05)^{-4}}{.05}\\
  &= -71,669
\end{aligned}
$$

Book: -\$95,405.20

---

## Finding the break-even payment

What would the lease payment have to be for both the lessor and the lessee to be
indifferent about the lease?

---

Given:

* Asset cost: \$5,200,000
* Depreciation: \$1,300,000 per year
* Tax rate: .35
* Lessor discount rate: .052 (same as lessee's after-tax borrowing rate)
* Asset has zero residual value after 4 years

The after-tax cost of owning:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Net cost of buying} &= 5,200,000 - \text{PV of tax shields}\\
  &= 5,200,000 - 1,614,110\\
  &= 3,585,890
\end{aligned}
$$

So the present value of after-tax lease payments must equal this:

$$
L \times \text{PVIFA}_{5.2\%,4} = 3,585,890
$$

Where:

$$
\text{PVIFA}_{5.2\%,4} = \frac{1 - (1 + .052)^{-4}}{.052} \approx 3.54595
$$

Solving for L:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L = \frac{3,585,890}{3.54595} \approx 1,010,677
\end{aligned}
$$

To get the pre-tax lease payment, divide by (1 - tax rate):

$$
\text{Lease payment} = \frac{1,010,677}{1 - 0.35} \approx 1,555,657
$$

From the lessor's point of view:

* Each year, revenue = \$1,555,657
* Depreciation = \$1,300,000 $\leftarrow$ Taxable income = \$255,657
* Taxes = 35\% \times \$255,657 = \$89,480
* After-tax cash flow = \$1,555,657 - \$89,480 = \$1,466,177

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PV} = 1,466,177 \times 3.54595 \approx 5,200,000
\end{aligned}
$$

so NPV = 0.

Final answer: \$1,555,657

---

## Taxes and leasing cash flows

Assume that your company does not contemplate paying taxes for the next several
years. What are the cash flows from leasing in this case?

---

If your company does not expect to pay taxes in the near future, then some key
tax-related benefits of ownership vanish. This has a big impact on the cash
flows from leasing, and it changes the leas-versus-buy decision.

### What changes when you're not paying taxes?

1. No tax shield on depreciation
2. No tax shield on lease payments
3. Your cash flows become purely pre-tax for both lease and buy decisions

Therefore the cash outflows are just the lease payments.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Cash outflows} &= (-L, -L, -L, -L)\\
  &= -\$1,525,000 \times (1 - (1.08)^{-4}/.08\\
  &= -\$5,050,993
\end{aligned}
$$

If you bought then you pay a one time \$5,200,000 upfront. Therefore, it would
be good to lease.

---

## Setting the lease payment

In the previous question, over what range of lease payments will the lease be
profitable for both parties?

---

We are looking for the range of lease payments that:

* Make the lessee better off leasing than buying (i.e., lessee's NPV > 0), and
* Make the lessor bettor off leasing than not leasing (i.e., lessor's NPV > 0).

The break-even lease payment for both is \$1,555,657.

This is the exact lease payment that makes both indiffereint---the present value
of lease cash flows equals the cost of buying (after adjusting for taxes and
depreciation).

### For the lessee

The lessee prefers leasing when the present value of lease payments is less than
the present value of buying, which we previously found was:

$$
\text{After-tax cost of owning} = \$3,585,890
$$

So, for the lessee, we solve:

$$
L_{\text{after-tax} < \frac{3,585,890}{3,54595} \approx 1,010,677
$$

COnverting to pre-tax lease payments:

$$
L < \frac{1,010,677}{0.65} = \$1,555,657
$$

So lesse wants lease payments to be below \$1,555,657

### For the lessor

The lessor prefers leasing when the present value of after-tax cash flows from
leasing is greater than \$5.2 million (initial investment):

We already saw that with:

* Pre-tax lease payment = \$1,555,657, the lessor breaks even (NPV = 0)

Therefore, the lessor only benefits when:

$$
L > \$1,555,657
$$

### Final answer

There's no overlap in lease payment ranges where both parties strictly
profit---the break-even lease payment is:

$$
L = \$1,555,657
$$

This means the only lease payment where both parties are indifferent (NPV = 0)
is exactly \$1,555,657.
